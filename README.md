-- before reading --
This project records what I have learnt for being a Product Manager.
This project is far from a real product team situation as the author is just a non-STEM graduate but trying to be as real as possible in order to gain experience of being a product manager.

The aim of this project is to improve the user-experience of utilising the subscription fuction of WeChat.
